# on-campus-book-transaction
Class project of Information Architecture, aimed at on-campus second-hand book transaction.
It is of great concern for students to buy their textbooks/reference books at the start of the semester; it can also be hard of students graduating to sell their books.
Currently some ways to manage book transaction are sending messages on ShuDong (an anonymous application where students can post messages), posting on BBS, and via WeChat groups. However, it is generally difficult to sell or buy books conveniently. This is how we came up with the idea of designing an on-campus book transaction website.
This project is mainly written in HTML, CSS, SQL and PHP.
